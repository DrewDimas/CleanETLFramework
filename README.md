# Data Preprocessing and ETL Pipeline Framework

![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-work_in_progress-yellow.svg)

## Objective
This project aims to develop an integrated Python framework that facilitates both the cleaning of raw data and its transformation and loading into a target system or database. It allows users to define custom data cleaning operations, transformation logic, and loading procedures through a unified interface, making it a versatile tool for data engineers.

## Key Components

### Modular Data Cleaning Library
This library within the framework includes a variety of data cleaning functions, such as missing value imputation, outlier detection, normalization, and categorical data encoding. Designed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, it ensures modularity and reusability, crucial for scalable software development.

### ETL Pipeline Constructor
This tool allows users to construct ETL pipelines by chaining together data cleaning, transformation, and loading steps. It provides a flexible API for defining custom transformation logic and integrating with various data sources and sinks, demonstrating advanced data integration capabilities.

### Configuration and Scripting Interface
A user-friendly interface for configuring ETL jobs, implemented through JSON or YAML files, or a domain-specific language (DSL). This enables users to specify data sources, cleaning operations, transformation rules, and loading destinations seamlessly.

### Performance Optimization
The framework includes features for parallel processing and efficient data handling to optimize performance for large datasets. Techniques include utilizing Pythonâ€™s multiprocessing library, leveraging vectorized operations with libraries like NumPy or Pandas, and optimizing SQL queries for efficient data extraction and loading.

### Testing and Documentation
Accompanied by comprehensive unit tests, integration tests, and documentation, ensuring framework reliability and maintainability. Testing frameworks like pytest validate the correctness of data cleaning functions and ETL processes, while tools like Sphinx generate accessible documentation.

### Example Projects and Tutorials
The repository includes example projects and tutorials covering common use cases, such as processing sales data, cleaning and loading survey data, or integrating with cloud-based storage solutions like AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage.
